# Iran Hosted Domains

- [داکیومنت فارسی](README.fa.md)

A lot of services and domains are outside of Iran and they are restricted or blocked by iranian censorship infrastructure or tech companies around the world, 
for accessing this service you need to use VPN or proxies with tunneling option, apart from these problems, when we use 
proxies the domestic services are unavailable because our IP is not in Iran; for bypassing these issues we gathered a list of 
Iranian domains and services to help our people bypass this situation.

## VPN & Proxy Problems in Iran

The following issues arise when using VPN for some Iran hosted websites:

- They may force you to have Iran IP to be able to access.
- They may offer 50% off bandwidth while having Iran IP.
- They may limit speed for non-Iran IPs or VPNs are slow.

## Usage

This can differ depending on which tool you use. You can download the domains list from
the [release page][link-release].  
In v2ray clients you can set Domain Resolution Strategy to `IPIfNonMatch` for better routing.
